Because the sound is coming from the internet, you will need a try-catch block (this
site might help you):

Write a program that shows two cars drawn with wheels and a body.
Use the Graphics class to draw these by hand, with arcs, circles, lines,
whatevers!
They should appear initially on the left slide of the screen and they will navigate
left and right.

You have considerable choice as to the look of your cars, but you must draw
them by hand.

At the bottom of your frame there should be the following gui's for each car:
(one set of each for each car--the cars are independent)

1.  A gui that starts a car and begins it movement to the right.
	IF the car goes off the screen it should start over on the other side.
2.  A slider that changes the speed of the car.
3.  A gui that that reverses the movement of the car from left to right or
	vice versa.
4.  A gui that stops a car.
5.  A gui that honks the horn for a short period of time
6.  A gui that turns on and off the radio.
7.  A gui that colors the car at least two different colors.

Using panels should be a great help!

Same rules as before. One file. Name the file correctly. I will run from 
jGrasp.

Try to make it so that resizing the frame is not a problem.
