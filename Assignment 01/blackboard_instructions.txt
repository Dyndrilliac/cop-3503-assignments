Assignment #1        NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS ACCEPTED PLEASE.     
DUE 11 pm, Thursday, January 17,  2013                  

This program will be written in Java.
Generally I will run your Java programs with jGrasp with Windows.
You can do your developmental work on any machine, but you must use SSH to ftp your code 
to Osprey so that you can use turnin (see #5 below).  I will receive your work on Osprey and then
ftp your code to Windows to use jGrasp to compile your code and execute your program.
So ALWAYS be sure your code runs on jGrasp (Windows version). Be careful naming your file.
It MUST be youruserid.java (and that MUST be a with a lower case n--Java IS case sensitive). 

The program that you turn in will always be in a single file named unfid.java where unfid
is YOUR unf id.  So , I would name my file n00009873.java . This implies that the name of the class 
containing main must be n00009873.  

So , in general, my class containing main will be named n00009873
and the file containing all my classes will be named n00009873.java
This holds for all assignments this term. KEEP THESE INSTRUCTIONS HANDY.


1.	log on to osprey.
2.	change your password (if you like!)
        $ passwd 

3.	Construct program 2.27 (not 2.25) on page 80 of the book.

Pay particular attention to the input and output as shown in the green box
so that, for example, 9% is entered as .09 and that the output is as specified for
arbitrary input. You do not have to do error checking for bad input.

	All of the source code should be in a single file , named unfid.java
	So my file would be named n00009873.java
	I need you to name your file youruserid.java because
	turnin (see #5 below) renames your turned in file to unfid, where unfid is YOUR 
	unf id and I 
	want an easy way to simply  rename your turned in file back to youruserid.java (!!!).
	I know this is convoluted, but I don't want you to use disks to turn in assignments.
	I want you to use turnin on Osprey.

4.      Compile the program:
        (this is how it is done on Osprey, but this one won't compile on Osprey because of its visual aspects)

        $ javac n00009873.java
	and execute the program-- 
	$ java n00009873


5.	turnin an electronic version of "unfid.java" using
	$ turnin unfid.java  kmartin.cop3503.a1
 (that is a-one not a-ell)
	When I get it , the system renames it unfid (YOUR unfid).

6.	check to see if the size of the file you saved is the same as the size
        of the file turned in

	$ turnin -c kmartin.cop3503.a1  (this is a-one, not a-ell)
        (tells you how many bytes you have turned in--check against how
        many you have saved) 
    	$ ls -l
        (list with long option)
 
Generally, I will compile your file  and then run it.  You should
do the same  using jGrasp on Windows to make sure you have done everything properly.

NEVER turnin ANY BINARY CODE IN THIS CLASS.  NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS ACCEPTED..GET IT DONE 
EARLY!
